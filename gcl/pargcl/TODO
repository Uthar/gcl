(help 'xxx) not working in ParGCL.  Why?

slave-listener not in MPI package.  Why?

slave should be in SLAVE-LISTENER package.
  or at least, not exported from MPIpackage

If we're calling (receive-message), and no message available,
we can't interrupt with ^C
Should catch interrupts with signal so that (receive-message ...)
won't block indefinitely when there's no message to receive.

Check if par-reset is stable, or can it corrupt the session?

Note also (getcwd) [STILL TRUE?]:
(getcwd) => reports too many allocated blocks ??
NOTE that the following workaround does work, however:
  (getcwd
      (make-array 256 :element-type 'string-char :fill-pointer t :static t))
